The person has gray skin, a partly robotic body connected to their head with wires, and is wearing glasses, and looks tired. The background is energy swirls of purple and yellow corresponding to the nonbinary flag." />

            I sometimes write sentences on <a rel="me" href="ciphertext.blog">ciphertext.blog</a>, and other times boost
            other people's sentences on mastodon <a rel="me"

        <h2>Previously on...</h2>
        <p>Before grad school, I was an undergrad at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca">UWaterloo</a>, where I spend lots of
            time at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum
                Computing</a>—some of it officially—where I drank lots of espresso and learnt a little quantum
            computing.
