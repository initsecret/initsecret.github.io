This talk will propose a new approach for building the next generation of AEAD. In the last few years, researchers and practitioners have discovered that widely deployed AEAD schemes, designed almost two decades ago, have many limitations. These range from uncomfortably small security margins to outright security vulnerabilities. We will discuss foundational theory and concrete designs for the next generation of AEAD schemes. Our designs better support real-world workloads while retaining performance.
